### Extra Features:
- [ ] Users can choose between light or dark colors to fulfill any expressive needs. This was achieved by creating a new button and setting the color
      ranges from 0 - 0.5 for dark colors and from 0.5 to 1 for lighter colors. 
- [ ] Users can change the color of the 3 text objects by tapping the corresponding button to create creative combinations. This was done using a similar idea to the background, but by calling .textColor on each label item.  


## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Favorite Applications and Features: 
WhattsApp- 
The checks that tell you both when a user received a message and when they manually opened it. 
Story Views. I can see who saw my story. It would be interesting to see how that is achieved. 

PolyCam- 
It allows you to have a 3D object of anything in real life that you have recorded with your phone. You can rotate the item

The Camera App-
Flipping the camera 

## Challenges
The first challenge I faced was exploring XCode. The instructions were clear, but because I had never used a playground before, it was new to me. I spent some time exploring XCode, not working on the project, just to familiarize myself with the Editor.

The second struggle I faced was aligning the labels and buttons. For some reason, it aligns well on the main view controller but not on the Simulator. I sued Align, and it did not change much. 

Thank you for the opportunity to apply to this course.
